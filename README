OVERVIEW

The Metatags plugin allows you to set

 <meta name="keywords" content="some,key,words">

and

  <meta name="descrition" content="Some description">

meta tags in HTML <head> section according to the page content. Currently meta
tags are supported in articles and staticpages.

USAGE

The Metatags plugin uses glFusion's autolink feature. If you have disabled it,
please enable the feature in Configuration UI (Miscellaneous - Miscellaneous -
Disable Autolinks).

In an article or a staticpage, if you write [meta:key comma_separated_keywords]
as an autotag, this tag will be converted into

  <meta name="keywords" content="comma_separated_keywords">.

For example, to have the following keywords shown in the header:

  [meta:key glfusion,cms,content management system]

Would produce:

  <meta name="keywords" content="glfusion,cms,content management system">.

Likewise, if you write [meta:desc description of the current page], the tag
will be converted into <meta name="description" content="description of the
current page">. In both cases, autotags themselves are not visible in the
content except for the editor(s).

For example, to place a meta description in a story, use:

  [meta:desc This is a description of this story]

Would produce

  <meta name="description" content="This is a description of this story">

Caution:Your keywords and description MUST NOT contain a right square
bracket(']').

CONFIGURATION

Once you have installed the Metatags plugin, it works well without manual
configuration. However, if you would like to change the name of autotag
(default value is 'meta') or keys translated into meta tag keys (default
values are 'key' and 'desc'), you can set up the plugin through
Configuration UI (http://yoursite/admin/configuration.php).

    * Autotag name: the name glFusion recognizes as an autotag (meta in the
      above USAGE)
    * Replace: keys (the label left to an textarea) will be converted into
      meta tag keys (the string in an textarea).  For example:

        tag use  => meta tag
        key      => keyword
        desc     => description
        au       => author

      [meta:au Mark R. Evans] translates to:
      <meta name="author" content="Mark R. Evans">

    * Default keywords (comma separated): keywords used globally when no
      article or staticpage is displayed, e.g., at the site's homepage
    * Default description: description used globally when no article or
      staticpage is displayed, e.g., at the site's homepage
    * Execute PHP: When parsing static pages for the meta auto tag, should
      the metatags plugin execute embedded PHP?  The default, and recommended
      setting for this is false.
    * Hide Tags for authors - By default, the meta auto tag will display
      in the story or staticpage only for content authors. Setting this to
      true will hide them completely (only visible when editing).
